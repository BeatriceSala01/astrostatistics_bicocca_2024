    "* We have a function $f(x_1, x_2)$ that returns $+1$ (blue) or $-1$ (orange).\n",
    "* We are given a dataset and split it into training and testing.\n",
    "* Hit play, and the network starts training.\n",
    "* The thickness of the line tells you how much that synapis contributes to the training.\n",
    "* You can monitor progress on the top-right.\n",
    "* The goal of the game is to minimize the loss function on the test set (I don't care about the loss function on the training set!).\n",
    "* You can change everything but the type of problem, the test/train ratio, and the noise level.\n",
    "* So feel free to play with activation function, number of layers, number of neuron per layers, learning rate, regularization, incoming features (data augmentation), etc.\n",

Let's start from [this dataset](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=linear&regularization=L2&batchSize=10&dataset=xor&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.01&regularizationRate=0&noise=35&networkShape=1&seed=0.50246&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false). Try to get the lowest score on the test set. Take a screenshot or we won't believe you! Let's draw a leaderboard.\n",
